## Abstract
Multi-parametric quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) has important applications in clinic. Multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) imaging can achieve single-shot multi-parametric qMRI. However, the existing methods mainly focus on single-slice reconstruction. To improve the reconstruction quality of parametric maps by exploring data redundancy among adjacent slices, we proposed a multi-slice information sharing method via multiple modulation patterns of MOLED k-space and deep neural network. The results show that our method can effectively utilize the correlation information among adjacent slices and improve the reconstruction quality compared to the single-slice reconstruction method.

(C)Three modulation patterns (MP-A, MP-B and MP-C) of the k-space were designed, which were used alternately in adjacent slices.
